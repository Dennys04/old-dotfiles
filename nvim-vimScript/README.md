# Classcial Neovim Configuration

This is a configuration for users who for some reason can't migrate
to Lua or maybe for some reason can't install a newer version of Neovim.

This is a more classical setup, so I'm trying to make as minimalist as possible,
which is why I'm looking for the best plugins that make this setup really profitable.
