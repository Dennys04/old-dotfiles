# Classcial Neovim Configuration

This is a configuration for users who for some reason can't migrate
to Lua or maybe for some reason can't install a newer version of Neovim.

This is a more classical setup, so I'm trying to make as minimalist as possible,
which is why I'm looking for the best plugins that make this setup really profitable.


__Plugin Manager__
[Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
If u want to install the same Plugin Manager, but u have more options
like: Vim Packer but I don't know how to use it.
